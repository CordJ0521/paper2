“Bugliosi wanted to be district attorney of Los Angeles, then move on to either attorney general or governor. I believe he even had presidential aspirations — and he also wanted to be wealthy, God bless him. He had a coauthor in the courtroom even before the trial began, though nobody knew about it at the time. One of Bugliosi’s co-prosecutors said he had his coauthor, Curt Gentry, in the front row every single day taking notes for the book they were working on together."

This quote says two things to me. First, Bugliosi had two of the biggest risk-factor qualities for corruption, greed and ambition. Second, he was working on Helter Skelter since before the trial started. If he already had the book deal signed and a co-author picked out and was taking notes for the book from Day1 of the trial, there's no way he wasn't working on the book before that. This suggests that Bugliosi had big plans for _Helter Skelter_, he may have even viewed it as a jumping off point to make his dreams of attorney general, governor, or even president, come true. If this was the case, he definitely would have been willing to bury any and all evidence that could have put this in jeopardy. Points to [[Bugliosi's Corruption]], especially when you consider that he was willing to tamper with evidence (see [[Bugliosi possible evidence tampering]]).
