"Charles Manson and his murderous cult made their mark on American pop culture, even inspiring the 2019 Quentin Tarantino film *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*... The staggering brutality of the so-called crime of the century captured America’s attention — as did the subsequent murder trial. The courtroom spectacle featured outbursts and threats by defendants with swastikas carved into their foreheads."

This quote would be useful in either the introduction or the first body paragraph. If this is used in the intro it would only be in reference and with regards to the part about *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, if used in the first body paragraph, however, this could be used in its entirety as a quote or the first part could be mentioned as a reference based on Coontz' info. This could be a really really good way to start of the first body paragraph actually, so avoid using the *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* reference in the into unless absolutely necessary.
