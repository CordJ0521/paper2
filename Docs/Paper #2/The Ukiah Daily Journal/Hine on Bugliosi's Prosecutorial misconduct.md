"Bugliosi, the DA who interviewed and prepped Melcher, knew Melcher lied on the stand and probably instructed him…  A DA who worked with Bugliosi on the case said it was prosecutorial misconduct sufficient to warrant a retrial… Susan Atkins… was offered a plea agreement in exchange for testifying against Manson & Family. She was represented by a court appointed lawyer named Gerald Condon.  The DA, fearing she might change her story at some point, felt a different lawyer might be able to better hold her in line, i.e., exert sufficient 'client control.' Following private meetings between the judge and the DA, and with neither the knowledge nor consent of the lawyer or defendant, the court dismissed Condon and appointed a new attorney, Dick Caballero.  Caballero had recently served eight years as a prosecutor in the LA District Attorneys office, and was well known to Bugliosi."

Bugliosi blatantly manipulated a defendent by forcing the judge to replace her attorney with one of his old buddies from the DA's offfice. This is huge evidence of [[Bugliosi's Corruption]], I honestly can't even think of an idea as to why the judge would allow this. This is a perfect quote to use in paragraph 3.
