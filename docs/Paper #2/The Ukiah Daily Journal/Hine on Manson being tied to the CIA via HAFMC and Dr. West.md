"Working hand-in-glove with the Haight Ashbury Freed Medical Clinic were CIA-sponsored agencies researching potential uses of LSD in interrogating foreign spies, homegrown dissidents, or inspiring controllable but amoral, behavior in groups of unsuspecting members.  This was the precise time and place Manson was assembling his riffraff mob… Heading the shadowy agency was Dr. Louis Jolyon West, a doctor long involved in LSD research and long associated with the CIA.  Author O’Neill links him directly to a 1950s case involving the murder of a child…The perpetrator was a patient of Dr. West’s and his behavior reeked of someone unwittingly dosed with LSD"

This quote outlines the connection between Manson and a theorized MKUltra researcher, Dr. Louis West. This connection is used as the other piece of main evidence for the CIA’s involvement in the case, along with Whitson and his supposed CIA ties (and his odd list of acquaintances). This would be a good quote to use to wrap up the second body paragraph. It's O'Neill's strongest evidence of CIA involvement, so it makes sense to end the theory support paragraph with it to really hammer it home, even though it's just circumstantial weirdness.
