"In his 2019 book… O’Neill asked forensic psychologist Alan Scheflin about the potentially tragic consequences of the CIA’s experimental mind-control program, MK-Ultra. Was it possible, O’Neill asked, that the Manson murders were part of an MK-Ultra experiment gone wrong? Scheflin responded, 'No, […] an MKULTRA experiment gone right.'"

O'Neill stands by this idea that he explicitly avoided drawing any conclusions in his book and he refuses to do so now unless he discovers conclusive proof in the future. Yet, he doesn't shy away from blatantly quoting others drawing provocative conclusions. This could also be very good for the first body paragraph, specifically to close it all out
