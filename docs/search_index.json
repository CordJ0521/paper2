Instead, he wrote to his superiors in Washington, DC, and tried to get Manson to be allowed to go live in Mexico, where obviously he couldn't be supervised. They thought Roger was crazy.

This could be pointing to Roger Smith's Corruption, however that would depend on how in the hell he ended up with only one client. It's definitely possible that he pulled some shit with the higher ups and complained about the time commitment to manage Manson and in doing so got his other cases transferred to other PO's over time, but I'm not sure if that's what happened. This could be referenced in the conclusion as a question left unanswered if I never find an explaination.</p> <p>Hine, Tom. \u201cAssignment: Ukiah \u2013 Charlie Manson and, Inevitably, Ukiah.\u201d The Ukiah Daily Journal, The Ukiah Daily Journal, 21 Nov. 2021, www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/2021/11/21/charlie-manson-and-inevitably-ukiah/.
