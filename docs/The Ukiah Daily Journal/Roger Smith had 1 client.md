"Federal parole officers routinely carry caseloads of 150 to 200 parolees.  Longtime parole officer Roger Smith had exactly one client:  Charles W. Manson."

While I don't think this will end up being used anywhere in the essay, it's definitely important to keep in mind. This could be pointing to [[Roger Smith's Corruption]], however that would depend on how in the hell he ended up with only one client. It's definitely possible that he pulled some shit with the higher ups and complained about the time commitment to manage Manson and in doing so got his other cases transferred to other PO's over time, but I'm not sure if that's what happened. This could be referenced in the conclusion as a question left unanswered if I never find an explaination.
