"During the time the Family’s Mary Brunner was in jail in Ukiah she gave birth.  The Mendocino County Courts made parole agent Roger Smith and his wife the foster parents of Charlie Manson’s baby."

In order for Smith to have been named as the foster father for Manson's child, he must have been close with manson, not just professionally but personally. I don't really know if this will make it into the final essay, I don't see a place for it, but for some reason I feel like it's important to keep in mind just in case. Tied in with [[Roger Smith's Corruption]].
